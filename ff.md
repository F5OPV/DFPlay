My vision of an ideal browser would include a session manager that allowed me to create, save, organize, archive, and erase browser  "sessions", "windows", and "tabs" ... for example: 
___
**Browser Sessions**
* Folder: "Work"
	* Folder: "Administrative"
	* Folder: "Projects"
		* Folder: "Development"
			* Session: "Pluto 2.1"
				* Window: "Project Management"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Development"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Test"
					* Tabs: ...
		* Folder: "Research"
		* Folder: "Other"
* Folder: "Home"
	* Folder: "Shopping"
		* Session: "POE Video Cameras"
			* Window: Hardware Options
				* Tabs: ...
			* Window: Software Options
				* Tabs: ...
* Folder: "Play"

___
***Right-clicking on "Browser Sessions" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse
 - close all
 - create new named folder or session
 
 ***Right-clicking on a "Folder" would allow me to***
 
 - expand/collapse
 - open all
 - close all
 - create new named subfolder or session
 - delete the folder and contents
 - rename the folder

***Right-clicking on a "Session" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse
 - open all windows
 - close all windows
 - rename the session
 - 

***Right-clicking on a "Window" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse (tab list)
 - open all tabs
 - open and load all tabs
 - close all tabs
 - rename the window

***Right-clicking on a "Tab" would allow me to*** 

 - open tab
 - open and load tab
 - close tab
 - copy URL
 - duplicate tab
  
"cut/copy/paste" and the ability to drag and drop folders, sessions, windows, and tabs should also be possible. 

Personally, I'd also like the ability to override tab names because the page name returned by many web sites is not meaningful.

Please recognize all this as a "conceptual brainstorming exercise" ... not something that is fully thought out.
