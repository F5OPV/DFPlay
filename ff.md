___

* Folder: "Work"
	* Folder: "Administrative"
	* Folder: "Projects"
		* Folder: "Development"
			* Session: "Pluto 2.1"
				* Window: "Project Management"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Development"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Test"
					* Tabs: ...
		* Folder: "Research"
		* Folder: "Other"
* Folder: "Home"
	* Folder: "Shopping"
		* Session: "POE Video Cameras"
			* Window: Hardware Options
				* Tabs: ...
			* Window: Software Options
				* Tabs: ...
* Folder: "Play"
