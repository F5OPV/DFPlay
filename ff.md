My vision of an ideal browser would include a session manager that allowed me to create, save, organize, archive, and erase browser  "sessions", "windows", and "tabs" ... for example: 
___
**Browser Sessions**
* Folder: "Work"
	* Folder: "Administrative"
	* Folder: "Projects"
		* Folder: "Development"
			* Session: "Pluto 2.1"
				* Window: "Project Management"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Development"
					* Tabs: ...
				* Window: "Test"
					* Tabs: ...
		* Folder: "Research"
		* Folder: "Other"
* Folder: "Home"
	* Folder: "Shopping"
		* Session: "POE Video Cameras"
			* Window: Hardware Options
				* Tabs: ...
			* Window: Software Options
				* Tabs: ...
* Folder: "Play"

___
***Right-clicking on "Browser Sessions" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse
 - close all
 - create new named folder or session
 
 ***Right-clicking on a "Folder" would allow me to***
 
 - expand/collapse
 - open all
 - close all
 - create new named subfolder or session
 - delete the folder and contents
 - rename folder

***Right-clicking on a "Session" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse
 - open all windows
 - close all windows
 - rename session
 - 

***Right-clicking on a "Window" would allow me to*** 

 - expand/collapse (tab list)
 - open all tabs
 - open and load all tabs
 - close all tabs
 - rename window

***Right-clicking on a "Tab" would allow me to*** 

 - open tab
 - open and load tab
 - close tab
 - copy URL
 - duplicate tab
  
"cut/copy/paste" and the ability to drag and drop folders, sessions, windows, and tabs should also be possible. 

Please recognize this as a "brainstorming concept" ... not something that is full thought out. 

Personally, I'd also like the ability to override tab names
